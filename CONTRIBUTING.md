# How to contribute

Package for applying dictionary filter to some form of query on database to retrieve filtered data or acquire filtered query.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a GitHub account. 
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Clone the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch fix/main/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git checkout fix/main/my_contribution`. Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository.
* Update your issue to mark that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed (Status: `Ready for Merge`).
